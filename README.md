# CSSE2002 - A1

## Task
The CSSE2002 teaching team want to create a new text-based farming game, but they are
so busy with teaching that they need your help to implement their vision! In this prototype first
version of the game, Farmer Ali is opening a small store to sell the goods she has made on her
farm. She is a very organised farmer, so keeps track of her shopâ€™s stock, as well as the customers
and sales records.
